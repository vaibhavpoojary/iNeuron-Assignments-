1. Is the Python Standard Library included with PyInputPlus?
Ans:-
    PyInputPlus is a Python module used for taking inputs with additional validation features. PyInputPlus will keep asking the user for text until they enter valid input.


2. Why is PyInputPlus commonly imported with import pyinputplus as pypi?
Ans:-
    You can import the module with import pyinputplus as pyip so that you can enter a shorter name when calling the module’s functions.
    PyInputPlus has functions for entering a variety of input, including strings, numbers, dates, yes/no, True/False, emails, and files.


3. How do you distinguish between inputInt() and inputFloat()?
Ans:-
    inputInt() : Accepts an integer value. This also takes additional parameters ‘min’, ‘max’, ‘greaterThan’ and ‘lessThan’  for bounds. Returns     an int.
    
    inputFloat() : Accepts a floating-point numeric value. Also takes additional ‘min’, ‘max’, ‘greaterThan’ and ‘lessThan’  parameters. Returns     a float.


4. Using PyInputPlus, how do you ensure that the user enters a whole number between 0 and 99?
Ans:-
    pip install pyinputplus
    import pyinputplus as pyip
    response = pyip.inputInt('Enter num: ', min=0,max=99)
    
        Enter num: 100
        Number must be at maximum 99.
        Enter num: -9
        Number must be at minimum 0.
        Enter num: 89.7
        '89.7' is not an integer.
        Enter num: gh
        'gh' is not an integer.
        Enter num: 95


5. What is transferred to the keyword arguments allowRegexes and blockRegexes?
Ans:-
     The allowRegexes and blockRegexes keyword arguments take a list of regular expression strings to determine what the PyInputPlus function will accept or reject as valid input.


6. If a blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3) do?
Ans:-
    inputStr() raises a TimeoutException exception. If the user answers incorrectly more than 3 times, it raises a RetryLimitException exception.


7. If blank input is entered three times, what does inputStr(limit=3, default='hello') do?
Ans:-
    import pyinputplus as pyip
    response = pyip.inputNum(limit=3, default='hello')
    
        hello
        'hello' is not a number.
        world
        'world' is not a number.
        45
