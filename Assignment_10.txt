1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?
Ans:-
    The shutil.copy() function will copy a single file, while shutil.copytree() will copy an entire folder, along with all its contents.
    

2. What function is used to rename files??
Ans:-
    The shutil.move() function is used for renaming files, as well as moving them.
    
    
3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?
Ans:-
    The send2trash functions will move a file or folder to the recycle bin, while shutil functions will permanently delete files and folders.


4.ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is
equivalent to File objects’ open() method?
Ans:-
    The zipfile.ZipFile() function is equivalent to the open() function; the first argument is the filename, and the second argument is the mode to open the ZIP file in (read, write, or append).


5. Create a programme that searches a folder tree for files with a certain file extension (such as .pdf
or .jpg). Copy these files from whatever location they are in to a new folder.
Ans:-

import os, shutil

def selectiveCopy(folder, extensions, destFolder):
    folder = os.path.abspath(folder)
    destFolder = os.path.abspath(destFolder)
    print('Looking in', folder, 'for files with extensions of', ', '.join(extensions))
    for foldername, subfolders, filenames in os.walk(folder):
        for filename in filenames:
            name, extension = os.path.splitext(filename)
            if extension in extensions:
                fileAbsPath = foldername + os.path.sep + filename
                print('Coping', fileAbsPath, 'to', destFolder)
                shutil.copy(fileAbsPath, destFolder)

extensions = ['.pdf', '.jpg']
folder = 'Downloads'
destFolder = 'selectiveFolder'
selectiveCopy(folder, extensions, destFolder)
