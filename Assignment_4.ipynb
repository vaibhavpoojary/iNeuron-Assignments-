    "bacon = [3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99] removes the first element called cat.\n",

    "9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "list concatenation : \" + \" is the list concatenation operator which is used to join the strings.\n",
    "list replication : \" * \" is the list replication operators used for strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "append() : append is the method used to insert the value into a list. The element will be added at end by default.\n",
    "insert() : insert is also a method to insert an element but we can insert the specific element at specific index.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "Using the remove() method.\n",
    "Using the list object's pop() method.\n",
    "Using the del operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "The values that make up a list are called its elements. Lists are similar to strings, which are ordered collections of characters, except that the elements of a list can have any type and for any one list, the items can be of different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "The key difference between the tuples and lists is that while the tuples are immutable objects the lists are mutable. This means that tuples cannot be changed while the lists can be modified. Tuples are more memory efficient than the lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "By using the trailing comma ( , )\n",
    "tuple = (1, 2, 42, 45)\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "List comprehension along with zip() function is used to convert the tuples to list and create a list of tuples. Python iter() function is used to iterate an element of an object at a time. The 'number' would specify the number of elements to be clubbed into a single tuple to form a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "Variables will contain references to list values rather than list values themselves. But for strings and integer values, variables simply contain the string or integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the extent possible) inserts references into it to the objects found in the original. A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original."
